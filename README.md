# DOB-Scan-Probe

This folder contains the code used for realization of my graduate thesis and publicaiton. This repository contains two separate folders, one containing the code I had used to train the artifical neural networks to perform the task of predicting the reduced scattering and absorption coefficients, using reflectance measurements collected using the DOB Scan Probe, and the other folder containing the code used for error plotting.
  
The results seen in my thesis and publication are generated using the code provided here.
